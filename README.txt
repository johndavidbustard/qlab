These are the resources from the Makerspace Robotic Arm introduction event.

To replicate this project you'll need to create an EV3 Lego Mindstorm robotic arm with a BrickPi.
The raspberry pi attached to the brick pi will need to run 'raspian for robots'.

Feel free to use the guide as a basic introdction as how to then program the arm with python.
